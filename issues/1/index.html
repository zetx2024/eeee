                Letter From Youth Research Journal
              </h2>
              <div class="content">
                Dear readers,<br />
                <span>Last season, we accepted many members to our research committee. We welcomed them thoroughly into our team and started preparing them for their future responsibilities of writing research papers for our Journal. However, the last season couldn't achieve the mission, which is publishing those papers.</span>
                <span>The season of 2022-2023 with the new board began achieving those goals. Working on their English skills, especially writing, was the first step on the road. After all, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. After improving their English skills, we sought to learn the ways of research from an expert, which is why the members joined the course "Writing in the any disciplines.". Each member was writing about different topics related to any topic, and while doing that, their work was being revised to catch the mistakes and perfect the writing skills of our members.</span>
                <span>The organization’s mission is to create an environment for scientists by allowing them to publish their articles in our Journal. Thus, we proudly announce that we are the first research journal in Bangladesh that fosters youth scientists to translate their thoughts into words by publishing their articles.</span>
                <span>We are thrilled to announce the publication of the season's first issue. The articles display the eagerness of the youth neuroscientists to conduct their own articles, adding their ideas and perspectives. We thank the committee head and his vices for their spectacular work as seniors who sacrificed their time to supervise this long project and the amazing contributors who had only the benefit of the team in their minds. Finally, we must credit the Youth Research Journal's research committee for their efforts and the live sessions about conducting a research article.</span>
                Best Regards,<br />
                Md Sanaul Haque Shanto <br />

                  <span>Abstract</span>
                  <span>The cerebrum, also known as the telencephalon or endbrain, is the largest part of the brain, containing the cerebral cortex (two hemispheres of the brain) as well as several subcortical structures such as the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and olfactory bulb. it is the uppermost region of the central nervous system in the human brain. The cerebrum develops from the forebrain during pregnancy (prosencephalon). The cerebrum is also divided into left and right cerebral hemispheres that are roughly symmetric. The cerebrum, with the help of the cerebellum, is in charge of all voluntary actions in the human body.</span>

                    <span class="order-0">The cerebrum, which is in front or top of the brainstem (as shown in Fig.1), makes up a large portion of the brain. It is the largest and most developed part of the brain's five major divisions in humans. In a phylogenetic sense, the cerebrum is the most recent structure, with mammals having the largest and most developed among all species. It contains the cerebral cortex that develops from the dorsal telencephalon or pallium, and the basal ganglia that develop from the ventral telencephalon, or sub-pallium, in mammals.  The cerebral cortex in larger mammals is folded into many gyri and sulci, allowing it to expand in a surface area without taking up much more volume. The cerebrum controls all voluntary actions in the body with the help of the cerebellum.</span>

                    <span class="order-0">A large sulcus divides the cortex into two hemispheres, right and left. The corpus callosum, a thick fiber bundle that connects the two hemispheres, allows information to flow from one side to the other. The right hemisphere is in charge of controlling and processing signals from the left side of the body, while the left hemisphere is in charge of controlling and processing signals from the right. Figure 2 shows the internal structure of the cerebral cortex.</span>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="order-0">Each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex has four functionally and spatially distinct lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital (as shown in Fig.3).</p>
                    <p class="order-1">The frontal lobe, located at the front of the brain, over the eyes, contains the olfactory bulb. The frontal lobe also houses the motor cortex, which is responsible for movement planning and execution.</p>
                    <p class="order-2">Processing somatosensorial (touch sensations such as pressure, pain, heat, and cold) and proprioception are two of the main functions of the parietal lobe (the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space).</p>
                    <p class="order-3">The temporal lobe is near the base of the brain, near the ears. Its primary function is to process and interpret sounds. It also houses the hippocampus, which is in charge of memory formation.  The occipital lobe is in the back of the brain. It is mostly concerned with the vision: seeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual world.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p class="subtitle ms-3">iii. Cerebrum function</p>
                  <span>The cerebrum directs the body's conscious or volitional motor functions. These functions originate in the primary motor cortex and other motor areas of the frontal lobe where actions are planned. Upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex extend axons to the brainstem and spinal cord, where they make synapses on lower motor neurons that innervate the muscles. Certain types of motor neuron disease can result from damage to motor areas in the cortex. Rather than total paralysis, this type of injury results in a loss of muscular power and precision.</span>
                  <span>The olfactory sensory system is distinctive in that neurons in the olfactory bulb elongate their axons directly to the olfactory cortex rather than to the thalamus. The sense of smell is lost when the olfactory bulb is damaged. Top-down information is also received by the olfactory bulb from brain areas such as the amygdala, neocortex, hippocampus, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra. Its potential functions can be classified into four non-exclusive categories: discriminating between odors, detection of odors with high sensitivity, filtration of background odors out,  and permission of higher brain areas, which are involved in arousal and attention, to modify odor detection or discrimination.</span>
                  <span>Parts of the cerebral cortex are primarily responsible for speech and language. Broca's area in the frontal lobe is responsible for motor aspects of language. Wernicke's area, located at the temporal-parietal lobe junction, is considered to be responsible for speech comprehension. Damage to the Broca's area causes expressive aphasia (non-fluent aphasia), whereas damage to the Wernicke area causes receptive aphasia.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                  <p class="subtitle">III. Cerebral lobes</p>
                  <span>Brain lobes (as shown in Fig.3) were once thought to be purely anatomical classifications, but we now know that they are also linked to specific brain functions. The largest portion of the human brain, the telencephalon (cerebrum), is divided into lobes like the cerebellum. If not otherwise specified, the term "brain lobes" refers to the telencephalon. The telencephalon has four uncontested lobes.</span>
                  <p class="subtitle ms-3">i. The frontal lobe</p>
                  <span>The frontal lobe is a region of the mammalian brain that is located in the front of each cerebral hemisphere, anterior to (in front of) the parietal lobe, and superior and anterior to the temporal lobes. It is separated from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus, which is a space between tissues, and from the temporal lobe by the lateral (Sylvian) sulcus, which is a deep fold. The primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts, is located in the precentral gyrus, which forms the posterior border of the frontal lobe.</span>
                  <span>The frontal lobe houses the majority of the cerebral cortex's dopamine-sensitive neurons. Dopamine is linked to reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. Dopamine tends to limit and select the sensory information sent to the forebrain by the thalamus. According to a National Institute of Mental Health report, a gene variant that reduces dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is associated with poorer performance in that region during memory tasks; this gene variant is also associated with a slightly increased risk of schizophrenia.</span>
                  <span>The frontal lobe contributes to our most human characteristics. Damage to the frontal lobe can cause personality changes and difficulty planning. The frontal lobes are the most distinguishing feature of the human brain.</span>
                  <p class="subtitle ms-3">ii. The parietal lobe</p>
                  <span>The parietal lobe is located above (superior to) the occipital lobe and behind (posterior to) the frontal lobe. The parietal lobe integrates sensory data from various modalities particularly spatial sense and navigation. It includes, for example, the somatosensory cortex and the dorsal stream of the visual system. This allows parietal cortex regions to map visually perceived objects into body coordinate positions.</span>
                  <span>Several areas of the parietal lobe play a role in language processing as well. This lobe also integrates information from various senses and aids in object manipulation. Visuospatial processing is carried out in parts of the parietal lobe.</span>
                  <p class="subtitle ms-3">iii. The occipital lobe</p>
                  <span>The two occipital lobes in the human cerebral cortex are the smallest of the four paired lobes. The occipital lobes are part of the forebrain and are located in the back of the skull. There are several lateral occipital gyri at the front edge of the occipital separated by lateral occipital sulci. The occipital lobe is involved in vision; lesions in this area can cause hallucinations.</span>
                  <p class="subtitle ms-3">iv. The temporal lobe</p>
                  <span>The temporal lobe is a cerebral cortex region located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain. The temporal lobes are involved in many functions including visual memory retention, sensory input processing, language comprehension, storing new memories, feeling, expressing emotion, and meaning derivation. The hippocampus is located in the temporal lobe and is important in the formation of explicit long-term memory, which is modulated by the amygdala. It is involved in the processing of complex stimuli as well as the senses of smell and sound.</span>

                        <figcaption>Figure 5: A human brain lateral cross-section: In this dissected human brain, white matter appears white, while grey matter appears darker. White matter is mostly made up of myelinated axons.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <span class="order-0">White matter is one of the two components of the central nervous system (CNS). It is made up primarily of glial cells and myelinated axons, and it makes up the majority of the deep parts of the cerebrum and the superficial parts of the spinal cord (as shown in Fig.5). Because myelin is primarily composed of lipid tissue with capillaries, white matter tissue in a freshly cut brain appears pinkish white to the naked eye.</span>
                    <p class="order-1">White matter axons carry nerve impulses between neurons and transmit signals from various grey matter areas (the locations of nerve cell bodies) of the cerebrum to one another. While grey matter is associated with processing and cognition, white matter modulates action potential distribution, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions.</p>

                  <p class="subtitle">V. Conclusion</p>
                  <span>The cerebrum is the brain's largest structure. It oversees memory, speech, senses, and emotional reactions. It is divided into four lobes: the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital. Each is in charge of a specific aspect of the cerebrum's functions. The cerebrum is composed of white matter, which is the tissue that allows messages to travel between different areas of grey matter in the central nervous system.</span>

                    >The words “addiction” and “habit” seem to be similar, but they are completely different; addiction is considered an illness that affects the individual’s whole life and his surroundings. Whether the person got addicted to good or bad behaviors, it is still the same condition. Addiction has different types. It is treatable and has special treatment centers and hospitals. Drug abuse and addiction to alcohol have become real threats to society. Addiction has no age; many teens and adults have been involved in the addiction of alcohol and drug abuse

                      >Addiction is a chronic disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. People with addiction use substances such as drugs and engage in compulsive behaviors despite the bad consequences. It starts when a person feels something enjoyable; the reward system in the brain releases dopamine and other chemicals. This action reinforces the brain’s association between certain things and feelings of pleasure, making the person want those things again. The desire to experience these things again grows
                      over time until it becomes a craving. This is the first sign of addiction. Through the continuous use of a substance or engaging in a behavior, the brain produces a large amount of dopamine. The brain’s reward system gets used to this amount and needs it. Then, the person loses interest in things he once enjoyed, because the brain no longer produces much dopamine in response to natural triggers. The addiction develops and the person becomes unable to control his need for substance or behavior, and cannot give up on it

                      >A binge/intoxication-related circuit, a withdrawal/negative affect-related circuit, and a preoccupation/anticipation (ie, craving)-related circuit have all been identified as having heuristic value for the study of neurobiological changes associated with the development and persistence of drug dependence (look at fig 2). Such pathways could be important in the treatment of drug addiction with CRF receptor antagonists, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a 41-amino acid polypeptide that mediates hormonal, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stressors. The acute
                      reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse in the binge/intoxication stage are most likely due to actions involving the ventral striatum and extended amygdala reward system, as well as dopaminergic and opioid inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, respectively <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="2.4">[4]</tooltip>.</span

                    >The symptoms of acute withdrawal that are critical for addiction, such as dysphoria and heightened anxiety associated with the withdrawal/negative affect stage, are most likely caused by deficits in the ventral striatum's reward function, but also the activation of brain stress neurocircuitry in the extended amygdala, including CRF and norepinephrine. The preoccupation/anticipation stage also involves key afferent glutamatergic projections to the extended amygdala and nucleus accumbent, specifically from the prefrontal cortex (for drug-induced reinstatement) and the
                    basolateral amygdala (for cue-induced reinstatement), as well as core elements of the brain stress systems in the extended amygdala (for stress-induced reinstatement). Compulsive drug-seeking is also thought to activate ventral striatal-ventral pallidal-thalamic-cortical loops, which may then engage dorsal striatal-pallidal-thalamic-cortical loops, with both effects influenced by concurrent decreases in reward function and activation of brain stress systems in the extended amygdala. The conceptual framework for this review paper is CRF's stimulation of the brain stress
                    system, which fosters addiction dependency and compulsivity <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="2.4">[4]</tooltip>.</span

The common addiction substances are alcohol, heroin, nicotine, cocaine, and cannabis. Multiple variables contribute to substance addiction and dependency, including genetic predisposition, environmental stresses, social pressures, individual personality traits, and psychiatric issues.
                    However, in all circumstances, it is impossible to tell which of these elements has the most impact on a single person. Substance use disorder is associated with some symptoms, which are the inability to think clearly, the cravings to need more of the substance; the usage of it during work, troubles managing the responsibilities, and the inability to stop the substance <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="2.2">[2,</tooltip>

However, the general signs of behavioral addiction include spending a lot of time engaging in the behavior, hiding it from other people, feeling anxiety or depression when attempting to quit, and difficulty in avoiding it. Behavioral addiction can be considered under the term “impulse control disorder”. Compulsive shopping,
                      pathologic skin picking, sexual addiction, excessive tanning, video game playing, and internet addiction are among the impulse control disorders, as in fig 3. It's still up for dispute which habits should be classified as behavioral addictions. Behavioral addictions should not include all impulse control disorders or diseases marked by impulsivity. Many impulse control disorders (e.g., pathological gambling) appear to have core characteristics in common with substance addictions

                      >The first step in treatment is detoxification. It involves clearing a substance from the body and limiting the reactions. If a person is addicted to more than one substance, they will often need medications to reduce withdrawal symptoms for each. Then, the common treatment is counseling therapies. Counseling helps people change behaviors and attitudes around using a substance, as well as strengthening life skills and supporting other treatments. There are different types of therapies include cognitive-behavioral therapy, multidimensional family therapy, and motivational
                      interviewing. Rehabilitation programs are longer-term treatment programs for substance-related and addictive disorders that can be highly effective and typically focus on remaining drug-free and resuming function within social responsibilities. Self-help groups, shown in fig 4, are where people of the same addiction meet and have conservation that leads to increase the motivation to stop the substance. People most commonly use medications during detoxification to manage withdrawal symptoms. They vary depending on the substance that the person is addicted to. Longer-term
                      use of medications helps to reduce cravings and prevents a return to using the substance after having recovered from addiction. Medication is not a standalone treatment for addiction and should accompany other management methods such as psychotherapy <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="2.7">[7]</tooltip>.</span

He took two groups of mice and separate them. Half of them were isolated in individual cages. The other half was housed in a giant, open-designed enclosure with walls painted to look like timber and cedar sawdust and dozens of crates for the mice to live and play in, essentially providing everything needed to keep the rats happy. Most importantly, the mice living in this enclosure were able to play
                      and socialize with each other.

In the second stage of the experiment, after the rats gradually got addicted to morphine, they were given morphine for 9 days, then given a free day. Of the two groups, the isolated rats increased their intake from morphine-water, while the Rat Park rats drank less and tried to resist consuming the
                    drugs; they tried to return their social life undisrupted by drugs.

                  <span>Parkinson’s has a long history. It is a very common neurodegenerative disease. It has been a great challenge to face and cope with and it may continue to be for the next couple of years.

Although Parkinson’s disease is hard to identify because it has many similar symptoms to other neurodegenerative diseases, some symptoms were found which are specific for Parkinson’s disease.</span>

                      >Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor control of our bodies and may has other noncognitive effects. It was first diagnosed in 1817 by James Parkinson. The disease has many subtypes and shares symptoms with other diseases. It can cause cognitive and noncognitive symptoms. It also can result in the development of dementia. Unfortunately, the direct cause behind its pathogenesis is still unknown but there are some present theories that try to connect the dots. The treatments of the disease are all symptomatic, and there aren’t any disease
                      modifying drugs. However, there are promising medications on the way. To understand how the treatments affect the disease, we have to look into its root causes.</span

                      >Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra are lost as we age. About one third of them are lost between the age of 20 and 90 years. The cause behind this is considered to be due to the oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species irregular manifestation). The enzymatic oxidation of dopamine generates hycytotoxic hydroxyl radicals in the presence of iron (Ⅱ) which is rich in the substantia nigra. On the other hand, non-enzymatic oxidation of dopamine yields superoxide, which produces a quinone that binds to a thiol group and denatures active protein. This evidence connects

Thus, aging has been considered to play a role in the development of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s was thought to be an accelerated form of aging. However, other processes are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease as the loss of dopamine neurons is different in aging and Parkinson’s disease. Other evidence supports the notion that neurotoxins are involved in the deterioration of
                      nigra-striatal dopamine system. A neurotoxin called (NM(R)Sal) was found to induce parkinsonism in rats. NM(R)Sal (R refers to R enantiomer) was found in the human brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and intraventricular fluid. (NM(R)Sal) is synthesized by a two-step enzyme reaction from dopamine as shown in Figure 1. (R)Sal is synthesized from dopamine and acetaldehyde by a (R)Salsolinol synthase and turns into (NM(R)Sal) with the addition of an N-methyltransferase

Also, the in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that the accumulation of (DMDHIQ+) in the substantia nigra is due to the binding of (DMDHIQ+) to neuromelanin (found in large quantities in the substantia nigra).

Parkinson’s disease includes the three most agreed upon symptoms: tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement). The onset of Parkinson’s disease may start as early as 12 to 14 years before diagnosis of the disease. Recent data support the fact that Parkinson’s disease start in the peripheral autonomic nervous system and/or olfactory bulb. Then, it spreads through the nervous system, affecting the lower
                      brain stem before reaching the substantia nigra. Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease depends on the presence of bradykinesia combined with rigidity or a resting tumor. Early symptoms generally show up asymmetrically, with the absence of atypical symptoms (cerebellar signs, early severe autonomic dysfunction, vertical supranuclear palsies, or cortical sensory loss), which would be indicative of an alternative diagnosis (9). In these cases, the asymmetric onset of symptoms and a good response to levodopa support Parkinson’s diagnosis in patients. Also, they are
                      important features to discriminate Parkinson’s disease from other form of Parkinsonism <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="3.2">[2]</tooltip>.</span

One subclassification based on clinical characteristics suggests two subtypes: a tremor dominant Parkinson’s disease and non-tremor dominant Parkinson’s disease. A patient with tremor dominant disease predominantly lacks other motor symptoms. On the other hand, a patient with a non-tremor dominant disease may have an akinetic rigid syndrome, a postural instability disorder, and increased incidence of non-motor
                      features. The course of the disease differs, and it has been postulated that the various subtypes have different causes and manners of development.

After absorption and transit across the blood brain barrier, it is converted into dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. Most patients must take a dose of 150 to 1000 mg daily, divided into multiple doses. As it is usual practice for Parkinson’s disease patients to take a low dose of levodopa, while increasing the dose based on the patient’s response to the treatment to balance it against the experienced adverse
                    effects. These effects of the drug are noticed quickly and may last for several hours. However, as the disease progresses in patients, the effect of the drug starts to wear off after shorter durations and there is a need to increase the frequency of taking doses. Moreover, prolonged use can result in significant motor complications, including dyskinesias, and severe on-off motor fluctuations. Another side effect of Levodopa is the on-off phenomenon, in which patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease experience rapid fluctuations in their motor function. During the
                    on-state, motor symptoms are controlled relatively well, but the rapid wearing of the levodopa leaves the patient in the off state, where they have severe motor Parkinsonian symptoms. The causes of these symptoms are probably the variable drug absorption and transit across the blood brain barrier, and the resulting fluctuations in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic dopamine levels in the nigrostriatal pathway.

This drug is mainly used in young patients at early stages of the disease to treat mild movement symptoms like tremors and muscle stiffness. Anticholinergic drugs play a role in tremor predominant Parkinson’s disease and may be used alone in the early stages of the disease. However, they are usually used in combination with levodopa and the other

Therefore, there are many researches on how it could be used in potential therapies. Therapeutic approaches have been developed to: reduce α-synuclein production, inhibit α-synuclein aggregation, increase intracellular and extracellular degradation of α-synuclein aggregates, and reduce the uptake of extracellular α-synuclein by neighboring cells

                    >Immunotherapies targeting α-synuclein are beginning to enter clinical trials. A Phase 1 chemical trial with the synthetic vaccine (a vaccine made of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates, or antigens) AFFITOPEPD03A containing α-synuclein mimicking peptide, has been completed. It was tested subcutaneously in 36 patients with early Parkinson’s disease and it was found to be well tolerated. An α- synuclein-targeting passive immunotherapeutic agent PRX002 has also been tested in Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials. A 96.5% reduction in free serum levels of α-synuclein was
                    observed. No major side effects or toxicity were observed and the drug progressed to Phase 2 clinical trials. Another α-synuclein-based passive immunotherapy called BIIB-054 was found to be well tolerated. A number of other immunotherapeutic agents are also under investigation. Furthermore, there are drugs that aim to result in increased extracellular degradation of α-synuclein are being considered as potential therapeutic options for Parkinson’s disease like Kallikrein 6. In addition to increasing α-synuclein degradation, another method would be to reduce α-synuclein
                    production. This may be achieved through RNA interference technology. On the other hand, some studies noticed that a significant reduction of α-synuclein was associated with escalated neurotoxicity and even degeneration of nigrostriatal system. Thus, preclinical safety data will be extremely necessary. Another approach for reducing α-synuclein production involves reducing its expression at a transcriptional level. Beta-2-adrenoreceptor agonists such as clenbuterol achieved a greater than 35% reduction in α-synuclein expression in a neuroblastoma (a type of cancer that forms
                    from immature nerve cells) cell line and in rat cortical neurons.</span

Nilotinib reduced the α-synuclein levels in mice and provided a degree of neuroprotection. It was well tolerated by Parkinson’s patients but with a much lower dosage than what is usually prescribed for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Nilotinib

                  <span>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, causing tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The neuroinflammatory phenotype of Parkinson’s disease leads to overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-γ due to neuroinflammation phenotype in PD patients. Pre-clinical rat models have shown that the Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription pathway (JAK/STAT) are over-activated, especially IL-6, IFN-γ, and MHC Class II. In this study, it is proposed to perform a trial on 1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice to test Ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor, as a novel medication for PD patients. There will be 3 groups to test the hypothesis: The first group will be given Ruxolitinib orally at 5 mg/kg, the second group will be given the same medication at 10 mg/kg, and the third group will be vehicle-treated (control group). After 4 weeks, the treated mice will undergo immunoblotting and electrophoresis to check if MHC Class II is expressed appropriately in the control groups and compare it and the results of administering Ruxolitinib. It is expected that there will be a noticed decrease of activation of the MHC Class II in the mice after the 4 weeks. This proposal if applied could show the potential of the JAK/STAT pathway as a therapeutic target to help slow down the progression of PD.</span>

                    <span class="order-0">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder. About 0.5- 1% of people aged 65 to 69 suffer from PD, which adds up to more than 10 million people worldwide <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.1">[1]</tooltip>. The major symptoms of PD include tremors, stiffness of limbs, slowness of movement, and impaired balance. Parkinson’s disease is caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in a part of the brain called substantia nigra pars compacta, which is responsible for producing dopamine, and accumulation of misfolded alpha-SYN inclusions called Lewy bodies <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.2">[2]</tooltip>. PD patients also lose the nerve endings that produce norepinephrine, the chemical messenger that is responsible for the sympathetic nervous functions of the body. When missense mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene are introduced, it leads to the familiar forms of PD, which are characterized by increased aggregation of lewy bodies <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.3">[3]</tooltip>. Research has shown that neuroinflammation processes in the brain play a critical factor in the pathogenesis of PD <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.4">[4]</tooltip>. This was also evident in a research paper where FK506 had high efficacy in reducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD patients <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.5">[5]</tooltip>.</span>
                  </div>
                  <span>Unfortunately, there is no definitive cure for PD that reverses its effects. Patients diagnosed with PD take drugs that increase dopamine, drugs that control other chemicals in the brain, or drugs that deal with nonmotor symptoms. This is largely due to the fact that the blood-brain barrier does not allow the passing of large molecules, which means that more than 98% of novel treatments cannot be administered. Current treatments include deep brain stimulation, MRI-guided focused ultrasound, and Levodopa, which are the most effective motor treatments of the symptoms of PD <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.6">[6]</tooltip>. Levodopa is the most used treatment for PD. However, levodopa only stops the tremors caused by Parkinson’s disease, but not the progression of the disease itself. Additionally, it has serious side-effects. Patients treated with Levodopa often have levodopa-induced dyskinesia, involuntary adventitious movements caused by prolonged treatment with levodopa <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.7">[7]</tooltip>. Levodopa takers have to take another medication along with it called Carbidopa, which only decreases the side effects of Levodopa. Other symptoms treatments include dopamine agonists that mimic the role of dopamine, MAO-B inhibitors that slow down dopamine breakdown, COMT inhibitors that help break down dopamine, Amantadine that reduces involuntary movements, and anticholinergic drugs that reduce muscle rigidity and tremors <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.8">[8]</tooltip>.</span>
                  <span>Thus, novel treatments for Parkinson’s disease need to be urgently found to help slow it down. In this research proposal, we will explore the prescription of Ruxolitinib, an ATP-competitive of JAK/STAT pathway, on Parkinson’s disease. Trials have shown that Ruxolitinib passes the blood-brain barrier successfully in phase 3 trials of HIV-1 infection <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.9">[9]</tooltip> and is also FDA-approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.10">[10]</tooltip>. It has never been tested before for Parkinson’s disease, but it has a high chance to be an effective medication to help slow it down.</span>

Ruxolitinib will be dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) in approximately 5 mg/ml solubility. They will be divided into 3 groups. The first group will be given Ruxolitinib orally at 5 mg/kg, the second group will be given Ruxolitinib also at 10 mg/kg, and the third group will be given dimethyl formamide because they will be the vehicle-treated group. This medication will be given to the MPTP-mice models using oral gavages daily for 2 weeks. After the induction, the presence of Parkinson’s disease will be measured in the mice by applying the following methodology to measure if the levels of MHC Class II protein were over-activated. Also, akinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait and posture disturbances should be observed in MPTP-induced mice.</span>

To begin, thirty micrograms of the ventral midbrain, which is shown in figure 2 of the mice will be lysed using ice-cold cell lysis buffer and a homogenizer. To maintain the brain’s state, it would be kept in a tissue collection solution (50% 0.01 moles of cold phosphate-buffered saline and 50% glycerol) and stored -20C for immunoblotting. The immunoblotting process is a technique that will be used for the analysis of the concentration of MHC Class II proteins in the ventral midbrain. It will also be used to measure the concentration of STAT1 and STAT3 using their respective antigens to test that the pathway is inhibited. The sample will be subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate the proteins of the cell sample by size using an electroporator with 10% stacking gel solution as shown in figure 3. 140 volts will be applied to the sample to allow efficient separation. The results will be compared to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as it is expressed at all levels in electrophoresis. The slowing down of the progression of Parkinson’s disease will be probed using antibodies of MHC Class II proteins <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.12">[12]</tooltip>.</span>

The transfer sandwich will be composed of a sponge, 3 filter papers, gel, PVDF membrane, 3 more filter papers in a sandwich structure as shown in figure 4. By placing electrodes on top of the sandwich and applying current, the cell sample on the gel will transfer onto the membrane because it will travel from the cathode to the anode. Lastly, the expression of the MHC Class II will be observed through observing the results in a dark room as the antibodies would be prepared with chemiluminescence.</p>

                    <span class="order-1">inson’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the midbrain. In PD patients, inclusions of aggregated a- synuclein (a-SYN) are prominent in dopaminergic neurons. Microglia exhibit pro-inflammatory properties in Parkinson’s Disease. Post-mortem studies of Parkinson’s disease patients have shown a correlation between activated microglia levels and MHC Class II expression levels, which is known to correlate with the level of alpha-synuclein <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.13">[13]</tooltip>.

                    <span class="order-0">The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is a signaling pathway used by cytokines to initiate innate immunity, orchestrate adaptive immune mechanisms, and constrain inflammatory responses. This pathway is made up of three major proteins: cell-surface receptors, JAKs, and STATs. Once a cytokine binds to the pathway receptor, receptor associated JAKs phosphorylate a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the cytokine receptor <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="4.15">[15]</tooltip>. This provides a docking site for STATs. After that, two STAT proteins bind to the receptor via its SH2 domains, as shown in figure 5, and are phosphorylated by the SH2-phosphate interactions between JAK and STAT proteins, inducing dimerization. The dimer then translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, binds to specific elements of DNA, and regulates the expression of certain cytokine-responsive genes (16). A summary of this pathway is shown in figure 6. In mammals, four JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and JAK4) and seven STATs (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6) have been identified.</span>

                  <span>Knowing that the JAK/STAT pathways play an essential role in Parkinson’s disease as many studies showed, the therapeutic potential of tackling the pathway is explored. This has been proposed to be done using JAK 1/2 inhibitors called Ruxolitinib. These novel medications in doses of 5 mg will be administered daily to MPTP-treated mice models of Parkinson’s Disease for 2 weeks. Using immunoblotting, the ventral midbrain will be examined to compare between them as control groups would have abnormal levels of STAT1 and STAT3 protein expression while mice treated with inhibitors will have less. Upon successful completion of this trial, PD therapeutics will be revolutionized.</span>
                  <span>As of future plans, the project shall escalate if successful to be tested on MPTP-induced primates. This will allow us to better test tolerance in primates and observe the drug’s efficacy on Parkinsonism in primates. Depending on the results of this trial, the next step will be determined. If successful for PD patients, the drug shall be passed onto for Phase I trials where it will test the drug and dosage on 20 to 100 healthy volunteers. The purpose of this phase will be mainly to make sure we have the safe dosage range. The second phase of clinical trials involves recruiting a small sample of PD patients with various disease severities to determine major and minor side effects and efficacy in PD populations. The main purpose of this phase will be to measure its efficacy in slowing down the progression of Parkinson’s disease and side-effects. This step could take more than 2 years. If these patients show positive results that support the hypothesis, we will look forward into further trials with increasing number of PD patients to measure its safety and efficacy.</span>

Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. The difference between dementia and Alzheimer’s is that dementia is an umbrella for multiple symptoms while alzheimer’s is progressive disease of the brain that slowly causes impairment in memory and cognitive function. Furthermore, it affects about 1% of 60-year-olds, and the prevalence
                    increases to 35% between 90-year-olds <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="5.4">[4]</tooltip>. Therefore, the study of Alzheimer’s disease has become a medical necessity. According to the Amyloid hypothesis, the primary cause of Alzheimer’s is the clustering of β amyloid into oligomers which is toxic. It is called β amyloid because of βsecretase which is the only secretase that creates β amyloid. β amyloid results from the cleavage of the protein β amyloid precursor
                    protein by β secretase and γ secretase enzymes. This causes a cascading effect that results in tau hyperphosphorylation and folding into tangles. These tangles cause the death of nerve cells and ultimately cognitive decline <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="5.4">[4]</tooltip>. Alzheimer’s disease is heterogeneous which makes it very hard to identify in its early stages. Some criteria were created by the (NINDS) to identify the disease. However, many neuropsychiatric
                    symptoms get mixed with cognitive defects, making it hard to study the disease’s symptoms. The state of treatments isn’t any better. The treatments are only symptomatic, and many new treatments are still experimental.</span

                  <span>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive chronic neurodegenerative disease caused mainly by a genetic mutation in the brain. The beta-amyloid hypothesis is a leading hypothesis that has been widely-accepted throughout the years .It indicates that clumps of beta-amyloid particles, which are cleaved from the protein APP on the neuronal membrane by an external enzyme known as beta-secretase, are the primary cause of AD. Despite the accuracy and extensive research on this particular theory, clinical trials and drug tests that specifically target (Aβ) almost never succeed in producing a medication that treats the disease from the core rather than just its symptoms like other medications on the market at the time, like memantine. The debate over the reliability of the beta-amyloid theory and the disappointing results of therapeutic trials for AD will be covered in this paper.  Moreover, other researchers have chosen a different path in their quest to learn more about possible explanations for AD. This paper will also go over some of the research done to demonstrate the pathological relationship and even the role of  Aβ disposition in the brain.</span>

In patients with mild and moderate  stages of AD, a BACE inhibitor inhibits the first enzymatic step of Aβ production. The inhibitors target these enzymes and stop their work that needs a subsequent course of immunological therapy to remove the amyloid. However, safety concerns persisted as a side effect related with the elimination of Aβ, which was dose-dependent and happened more frequently in ApoE allele 4 carriers than non-carriers. This was demonstrated by monitoring the Aβ levels in the CSF. ApoE, a protein that moves lipids throughout the body, is available in three different forms: e2, e3, and e4. If someone has the e4 allele from either parent, their chance of developing AD is up to 3 or 4 times higher than that of the general population. However, if they have the ApoE 4 allele from both parents, their risk is up to 10 to 14 times higher than that of the general population. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="6.13">[13]</tooltip></span>

                  <span>Other researchers have dug up to see if there was another approach to explore the AD brain since the results of these clinical trials points to the possibility that the amyloid theory may be incorrect. They followed a completely different road, which was pathology.They used mathematical models by collecting information from brain banks, collection of brain tissue samples from people who donated their brains after they die for research purposes. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="6.14">[14]</tooltip></span>
                  They have compared healthy brain tissue to people who had plaques and tangles in their brains but didn’t have symptoms yet. They specifically looked for networks of genes that were behaving very differently in AD, such as APP, PSEN1, PSEN2. It was suggested that a link is present between viral infections and plaque formation in  animal models .They concentrated on specimens from the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, areas of the brain known to have the most severe neuronal loss in AD. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="6.15">[15]</tooltip></div>
                  <span>These samples encouraged them to propose an alternative model for AD, clarifying that the amyloid theory is only a factor, not a cause. For further examination, they have checked for 500 viruses in 4 different brain regions in over 600 brain samples. Two viruses in particular, which are types of herpes virus, were elevated in AD brains that may be a correlation too. They support the theory that Herpesviridae infection might encourage amyloid-amyloidosis, the formation of plaques.These findings with earlier researchers, found a substantial association between HSV-1 and AD. The virus has also been found in amyloid plaques in brain autopsy of AD. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="6.16">[16]</tooltip></span>
                  <span>Other researchers discovered that the severity of the sickness increased with the amount of genetic material that viruses had deposited in people's brains. It's possible that minor variations in people's DNA are enabling the viruses to cause more harm. According to their theory, people who are more susceptible to AD are likely to have a combination of a viral infection and a specific genetic predisposition.
                    They also conducted an experiment in which they eliminated a gene that one of these viruses had rejected, which resulted in an increase in brain plaques. These findings clearly imply that viruses are at least largely responsible for the disease, but they do not confirm causation. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="6.17">[17]</tooltip></span>

                  <span>In conclusion, it is perfectly feasible that AD is brought on or progresses in many ways; consequently, the virus may be implicated in some cases but not others, and a person's immune system may also be engaged. Additionally, measuring AD from a single angle is ineffective for identifying its causes or finding a suitable medication to treat it. There are several reasons why these trials fail, some of which include:  selection of the wrong patient population, Variability in clinical progression rate,Inadequate dosage or exposure to drugs, The wrong time to intervene and  The clinical scales' lack of sensitivity.</span>

                      >Alzheimer's disease is characterized by memory loss from neuronal degeneration, cognitive decline, and dementia. It occurs due to the widespread loss of neurons and destruction of synaptic networks throughout the brain cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and basal forebrain (look at figure 3). Usually, the patient’s brain has pathologic marks, which are beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaque and neurofibrillary tangle. A neurofibrillary tangle is formed by hyperphosphorylation of a microtubule-associated protein known as tau

Stem cell therapies target the cholinergic system in order to provide environmental enrichment. The enhancement of cholinergic function improves its behavioral and cognitive defects. Due to the fact that neurogenesis in the hippocampus decreases as we age, therapies that protect the neurons, increase neurogenesis, and replace lost cells may slow down the progression of the disease or completely stop it. Stem cell-therapies show good results in animal models; however, there is

Patients’ dopaminergic neurons can be used to treat Parkinson’s disease with induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. Transplantation of these patients’ specific neurons into a rodent model has shown significant functional recovery. Mesenchymal stem cells transplantations are the most suitable for the clinical
                    setting for their neurotrophic and immunomodulatory effects and potential. In a rat model, mesenchymal stem cells transplantation had a protective effect against dopaminergic neuronal death. Also, neuroprotection can be useful in supporting the existence of dopaminergic neurons and slowing disease progression. A combination of cellular replacement and neuroprotection may improve the efficacy of cell therapies for Parkinson’s.

Music is more than some tones; music can help treat some severe diseases and significantly impact the physical and mental state of the person, which can be called music therapy. Music therapy is an allied health profession, " the clinical and evidence-based use of music treatments to
                    achieve customised objectives within a therapeutic relationship by a certified practitioner who has completed an accredited music therapy curriculum." Music therapy is a diverse discipline. Music therapists use music-based experiences to address client needs in one or more of the following domains of human functioning: cognitive, academic, emotional/psychological; behavioural; communication; social; physiological (sensory, motor, pain, neurological, and other physical systems), spiritual, and aesthetics. This research paper aims to cover how the human brain understands and
                    processes sound, specifically music.</span

                    >Vibrations from a sound system pass through the air and enter the ear canal. These vibrations irritate the eardrum and are converted into an electrical signal, which goes down the auditory nerve to the brain stem and is reconstructed into what’s referred to as music. Music is considered a popular entertainment and potent stimulation for brain waves. Music characteristics alter depending on the style and genre of music, resulting in varied impacts on brain activity.

Similarly, meditation music can help relax the mind and the body. And, regardless of the listener's prior mood, catchy pop music might induce an easy smile. The amygdala is responsible for all these physiological reactions to music.

                    <span class="order-0">The cerebellum is a part of the brain located at the back of the brain between the occipital and temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex. Despite accounting for only around 10% of the brain's volume, the cerebellum contains more than 50% of the brain's total number of neurons. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.9">[9]</tooltip></span>
                    <span class="order-1">The cerebellum does not originate motor signals; it changes motor commands from the descending pathways to make motions more adaptable and accurate. Movement is a typical musical result and is closely related to the cerebellum. The cerebellum is the brain region that prompts and coordinates movement in reaction to (or in rhythm with) music, whether tapping a foot, dancing a jig, or plucking an air guitar.</span>
                    <span class="order-2">Playing instruments is likewise entirely dependent on this portion of the brain. According to research, even a few weeks of piano training can affect the cerebellum. Those functional alterations aren't limited to performing music; simply listening to music or envisioning playing the piano can have the same effect.</span>
                    <span class="order-3"
                      >The cerebellum is also in charge of muscle memory. While cognitive ability and long-term memory might deteriorate with age, the cerebellum matures differently as a discrete portion of the brain. This has resulted in reports of coma patients reacting to the music, Alzheimer's patients playing instruments, and stroke sufferers rediscovering their voices via singing. As a result, the cerebellum is very useful for various types of music therapy.

                    <span class="order-0">The hippocampus is a complicated brain region located deep within the temporal lobe. It serves a crucial role in learning and memory. It is a malleable and fragile structure that many stressors may harm. According to research, it is also impacted by several neurological and mental illnesses. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.11">[11]</tooltip></span>
                    <span class="order-1">Music does not simply have a momentary influence on the brain; research reveals that hearing or playing music changes brain shape and brain function, especially when the same music is played again. This is because the hippocampus is opposed to the cerebellum.</span>

                    <span class="order-0">Scientific research on the hippocampus has revealed a substantial relationship between music listening and long-term and short-term memory. With its themes and phrases, music's repetitive nature stimulates short-term memory while creating long-term memories. That's why individuals may remember a song they heard on the radio the day before but also recall the dress they wore and who else was in the car when they heard that music 30 years later.</span>
                    <span class="order-1"
                      >This impact varies depending on the sort of music being played. This lends credence to the notion that music may strongly influence brain activity. Music may be produced to target different brain areas, eliciting various emotions from the listener. While this enables musicians and composers to create profoundly emotional music works, it also demonstrates that music may be a beneficial tool for healthcare practitioners.

                  <span
                    >Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that transmits information between nerve cells. It is also an essential and dangerous hormone that helps improve mood and a feeling of inner happiness and very comfortable satisfaction within a system known as the reward system within the brain. Neurons in the brain release dopamine within several dopaminergic pathways when doing a favourite thing or beloved to us, regardless of whether it is helpful or harmful.

                    >Thus, if this statement is confirmed, it indicates that music has two positive and harmful effects in the long run. As for the positive impact, it is represented in the feeling of pleasure, happiness, and satisfaction associated with listening to music and thus relaxation of nerves and calm. The bad thing is that research confirms that the secretion of dopamine over time is a result of Doing a sure thing that will lead to addiction, and thus addiction to music, which may hurt the person, and from here conclude that listening to purposeful music must be sponsored to avoid

                  <span>Most people have tried listening to music while performing specific tasks, such as studying while listening to music, believing that this helps them focus, motivates them to continue, and improves their mood, increasing their productive and absorptive capacity.</span>
                  <p>The result was uneven for people; for some, it was positive for him and increased their production capacity and helped them well, while for others, the music distracted their attention and reduced their productivity in the same period compared to others.</p>
                  <p>The answer to this problem is that music does not affect people similarly. It differs from one person to another. It may be helpful for people to produce and harmful to others.</p>
                  <p>When music is helpful for a person while performing his tasks, it will reduce pressure and impressively stimulate him, improve his mood, and help him to focus, memorise and understand well. Still, to be helpful, certain types of music must be listened to because some music may be harmful to them, and the kind of music varies according to the person the listener.</p>
                  <p>As for the other type of people harmed by listening to music while working, this happens because it reduces their focus, distracts their attention, and makes memorising and understanding complex. Therefore, the matter varies from person to person, and the process is not equal for everyone. The person must try it himself, in the beginning, to determine his condition in this matter. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.15">[15]</tooltip></p>

                  <span>Autism spectrum disorder is a brain development illness that affects how a person sees and socialises with others, producing difficulties with social interaction and communication. The condition also exhibits restricted and repetitive behavioural patterns. The word "spectrum" refers to the various symptoms and severity associated with an autism spectrum disorder.</span>

                    <span class="order-0">Autism spectrum disorder encompasses formerly distinct disorders such as autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and an unidentified kind of pervasive developmental disability. Some individuals still refer to autism spectrum disorder as "Asperger's syndrome," which is widely regarded at the moderate end of the spectrum. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.18">[18]</tooltip></span>
                  </div>
                  <p>Autism spectrum condition manifests itself in early infancy and ultimately creates social, academic, and occupational functioning difficulties. Autism symptoms often appear in youngsters during the first year of life. A tiny proportion of children seem to grow normally in the first year but subsequently have regression between 18 and 24 months when they acquire autistic symptoms.</p>
                  <p>While there is no cure for autism spectrum conditions, early intervention may significantly impact the lives of many children.</p>
                  <p>Music therapy may assist children with ASD in improving their abilities in main outcome areas such as social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behaviour, and socioemotional reciprocity. Within the treatment framework, music therapy may also assist in improving nonverbal communication abilities. Furthermore, music therapy may enhance social adaption abilities in children with ASD and promote the quality of parent-child interactions in secondary outcome domains.</p>
                  <p>
                    Children with ASD have the same obstacles in music therapy as in other therapeutic modalities, in school settings, or at home. To date, research has provided some evidence of effectiveness. In secondary and tertiary diagnostic services, child development centres, and clinical and educational settings where music therapy is included as part of the multidisciplinary services, this intervention is most notable in promoting interpersonal communication, reciprocity, and the development of relationship-building skills.

                      >Alzheimer's disease is a brain illness that progressively deteriorates memory and cognitive functions, as well as the ability to do fundamental tasks. Most people with the disease — those with late-onset symptoms — have symptoms in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease is uncommon and occurs between 30 and 60. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia among the elderly. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.20">[20]</tooltip></span

                    <p class="order-1">Because there is no treatment for the condition, others focus on measures to enhance a patient's quality of life. Music has several advantages for people living with Alzheimer’s at various stages of the illness. Music therapy has been shown in studies to enhance a patient's attention and capacity to interact with people close to them and may reduce their need for psychiatric medicines.</p>
                    <p class="order-2">Music has various advantages for people with Alzheimer’s at each stage of the illness. This is particularly true in the latter stages of Alzheimer's disease, when individuals may become disconnected from their surroundings and lose their capacity to interact and connect with people verbally.</p>
                    <p class="order-3">
                      When people with Alzheimer’s hear music, they often experience a perceptible shift. They may perk up and become more interested in their environment. They may sing, dance, or clap their hands when they hear music. Responses to rhythm bypass the brain's standard response mechanism. Instead, the brain reacts directly to the music and instructs the body to respond by clapping, swaying, or humming. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.21">[21]</tooltip>

                    <p class="order-4">Going out dancing or attending a concert may aid patients in the early stages of the condition. Respect their preferences, even music they used to like. Brain alterations may influence their musical perception. Those who used to play an instrument may find it pleasurable to do so again. Note and play precious pieces, such as wedding tunes, to evoke good recollections.</p>
                    <p class="order-5">
                      As the condition worsens, listening to music while walking may improve balance. Music may also be utilised to lift a person with Alzheimer's mood, and relaxing music can assist with nocturnal behaviour concerns. Later, while recalling old occurrences, the same favoured bits may spark a person's recollection. Music often stimulates people living with advanced Alzheimer’s to exercise. Relaxing music also relaxes and comforts.

                  <p class="subtitle ms-3">iii. Chronic pain</p>
                  <span>Endorphins are released when listening to music, according to this article. Endorphins are chemicals that interact with pain receptors in bodies, disrupting pain signals and providing a sense of well-being. They operate similarly to opioids but without undesirable side effects. Endorphins function as the body's natural painkillers.</span>
                  <p>For years, music has been used to treat acute pain (such as during cancer treatment and before, during, and after surgery) with substantial success. Many studies show that when music therapy is used after surgery, patients take fewer painkillers and have a more positive attitude. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.23">[23]</tooltip></p>
                  <p>This use of music in acute pain treatment may also be used for chronic pain. In the long run, the same analgesic effect may be obtained, reducing the need for medicines. When combined with other established pain treatment techniques and therapies, patients may have a significant reduction in pain and a notable increase in their levels of functioning.</p>
                  <p>
                    Studies show that music stimulates parts of the brain that control and decrease pain. This indicates that listening to music may assist the brain in managing and minimise discomfort in the body. Those suffering from chronic pain often feel detached or dissociated from our bodies as a coping mechanism. This may lead to a loss of self-awareness. Patients may benefit from music therapy by being more aware of their bodies and reconnecting with themselves. This understanding may assist patients in learning how to control their symptoms better.

                  </p>
                  <p>Distraction tactics (such as listening to music) may be helpful in everyday life. Distraction is one of the primary coping mechanisms to deal with chronic pain and bipolar condition. Distracting allows attention to more positive things rather than lingering anxieties or pessimism. Music can greatly assist, whether it's distracting from discomfort during exercise or singing a song to improve mood and re-energize when taking a break from work.</p>
                  <p>Research on the use of music as a treatment for chronic pain sufferers discovered that those who listened to music had a higher quality of life despite their discomfort. "Music may offer an emotionally engaging diversion capable of lowering both the sense of pain and the associated unpleasant affective experience," they discovered.</p>
                  <p>Many patients retreat from social events for fear of aggravating their pain or inability to keep up with loved ones. This may lead to loneliness, exacerbating chronic pain symptoms, stress, and destructive emotions. Music therapy may provide a feeling of connection and involvement, mainly when done in a group setting where patients can meet others who are going through similar challenges. <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="8.25">[25]</tooltip></p>

                    >Many things related to the effect of music on the brain have been clarified in two ways, the first psychological and the other from an anatomical point of view of the brain. From a psychological point of view, it was concluded that music affects mood, attention, and memory. The seven strategies that improve the listener's perspective were concluded behind the impact of music on dopamine. The impact of music on memory was influential, as it is used to enhance the process of treating Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, the research paper showed how music affects the
                    brain in terms of the physiology of some parts of the brain affected by music. At the beginning of this part, the mechanism of the hearing process and its understanding through the brain have been explained well. The five elements of the brain that are affected by music have been clarified: the temporal lobe, amygdala, frontal lobe cerebellum, and hippocampus. The location of each part of the brain, its role in the listening process, and the effect of music on it were shown clearly. In the third and final section of the research paper, the significant role of music in
                    treating many diseases and solving many health problems was presented. It has been shown that music therapy effectively solves many health problems, and four examples of health problems that music can contribute to their treatment have been clarified. These four diseases are autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Alzheimer's disease, chronic pain, and substance abuse. From all these words, we can deduce the role of music and sounds in our lives. In the end, every process that happens is calculated and accurate, and not a coincidence, and with careful consideration and patience,
                    everything can be exploited for the benefit of man.</span

                    >Variation in mental health among people may usually indicate the persistence of mental illnesses even if the individual lacks the diagnostic criteria for this illness. In order to clarify the factors that reveal the presence of mental illness risks, and the subclinical problems affecting life quality, it is essential to study and analyze the individual variability regarding their mental health. In fact, studying the relationship between mental health symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity patterns in cognitive control systems is the key which will reveal a
                    better understanding of the variability of the brain’s large-scaled mechanism. The frontoparietal cognitive control network (FPN) is a control network serving to rapidly and instantiate new task states by flexibly interacting with other control and processing networks. Any change in FPN would disrupt the ability of symptoms regulation resulting in negatively mental health impacts. In fact, depression symptoms severity negatively correlated with between-network global connectivity (BGC) of the FPN. From this, it is supposed that any decrease in the connectivity between the
                    FPN and the rest parts of the brain is related to increasing the severity of depression symptoms for the person in general.</span

                  <span
                    >Depression, altering more than 264 million people around the world1, is a severe mental health disorder that frequently leads to suicide. In order to be diagnosed with depression, a patient should meet at least four symptoms based on criteria. Also, the symptoms should have persisted for two weeks. The criteria are irritability, anorexia, feeling empty or sad, insomnia, and weight change. Although some people might not meet the criteria, they would experience some symptoms of depression. In this review, this natural variability was used, helping in comprehending the
                    neuroscience of poor mental health and factors that might contribute to developing a severe mental illness. One study hypothesized that symptoms of poor mental health are related to the Front-parietal network (FPN). According to another study, the FPN has a physiological role in protecting against mental health symptoms.</span
                  >
                  <p>
                    Disturbance in the FPN function, altering the domain-general neurocognitive feedback system capable of regulating symptoms as they occur, is the primary reason for multiple mental disorders. The FPN is a flexible hub, which means it can quickly modify the functional connections regarding its goals because it has high connectivity across the brain. Individual variations in the overall capacity to control cognition can influence symptoms, according to significant evidence that the FPN functions are domain-general. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, attention deficit
                    hyperactivity disorder, and eating disorders have been noticed in patients with disturbances in FPN functional connectivity (FC). In this review, we focused on FC assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), estimated as the material connection in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal between brain areas. At the same time, individuals relax in the scanner.
                  </p>
                  <p>Two studies estimated a summary statistic regarding the level of conductivity of FPN around the brain. However, the relative size of different networks can impact these calculations. For instance, nodes with a smaller network will have fewer connections than the more extensive network. Thus, a study used between-network global connectivity (BGC) to determine how effectively a brain area is connected to its rest.</p>
                  <p>
                    Patients suffering from severe depression had anomalies in FC patterns in the brain, which involved FPN functional connections. In addition, patients suffering from depression had lower conductivity between FPN areas. A similar result was seen in undiagnosed people with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, according to another research, global brain connectivity was reduced in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and medial prefrontal cortex sections of FPN in individuals with depression. Moreover, A disruption in FC within the DLPFC has been indicated in patients
                    suffering from depression. Also, the same result was found in the default mode network (DMN). Researchers have also sought to categorize depression based on FC patterns. The reduced connectivity in FPN is the most common subtype involving fatigue and anxiety. In addition, when patients are trying to regulate their emotions or being threatened activation in the FPN and changes in FPN FC have been indicated. There is a decline in global brain connectivity in depressed individuals; the FC value for each region's connections has been revealed inside the prefrontal cortex. The
                    loss in global brain connection was saved by using ketamine therapy.
                  </p>
                  <p>Research on the global connectivity of the front-parietal cognitive control network will be reviewed in this review. It was expected that individual variations in depression symptoms in undiagnosed persons would relate to BGC in the FPN, based on a previously proposed theoretical framework and detected FPN FC changes in patients with severe depression. Support for our theory would give vital evidence for the possibly widespread involvement of global FPN intrinsic FC in controlling mental health symptoms.</p>

Hippocampus is a complex brain structure embedded deep into the temporal lobe. Notably, people with depression frequently have reduced hippocampus volume, which correlates with depressive episodes' length and frequency. Major depressive disorder affects several areas of the brain (figure 1). The Monoaminergic neurotransmission influences these brain areas' structure and function by providing the neural basis for mood, motivation, and reward. Consequently,
                      disruptions in the functional connectivity in these neural networks play a vital role in developing severe depression. Three critical hormones are commonly modulated by monoaminergic neurotransmission: serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.</span

The number of particular types of neurons and their synaptic connections, the intracellular transduction of neuronal signals, the metabolism of neurotransmitters and their receptors, and the changes in response to environmental stressors are mainly controlled by the polymorphisms. The serotonin transporter gene is the most studied in major depressive disorder. It has a polymorphism that results in two distinct alleles (long and short). The short allele slows down the serotonin
                      transporter's production. Consequently, the rate at which serotonin neurons adjust to changes in their stimulation is considered slowing down. The polymorphism may affect a person's sensitivity to stress since an acute stressor boosts serotonin release.</span

                    >Dopamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter responsible for the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. In our case study, dopamine plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. Prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum dopamine levels rise in response to amygdala-perceived environmental threats. Local inhibitory feedback makes sure that equilibrium is restored. A significant stressor can interfere with this feedback mechanism by changing the amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factors in the striatum. For example, an improper salience
                    or slightly unpleasant stimuli may result from abnormal feedback in the striatal dopamine system. The impact of stressful life events in the past on current mood is influenced by a variation in the dopamine type 2 receptor gene. In MDD patients, a severe increase of striatal D2 receptor binding in the amygdala's postmortem central and basal nuclei. Through interactions with the environment, the dopamine system's genetic make-up may impact sensitivity to major depressive disorder, which results in Anhedonia: the inability to feel pleasure.</span

NE plays a determinant role in executive functioning, regulating cognition, motivation, and intellect, which are fundamental in social relationships.

                      >The density and sensitivity of 2α-adrenoceptors, which modulate NE release, are altered by increased β-adrenergic receptor binding in the frontal cortex in MDD patients. Additionally, locus coeruleus postmortem tissues from people with significant depression have been shown to have reduced NE transporter binding. All of these alterations are caused by the physiopathology of depression. Regardless of the explanation, these findings suggest that NE plays a significant role in depression. Dare decreased alertness, low energy, issues with inattention, focus, and cognitive
                      function are linked to lower NE neurotransmission.</span

                  <p>FPN is a system responsible for the general goal-attaining process, involving regulating the mental disorder symptoms. Thus, the differences in FPN BGC are somehow related to depression symptoms. A study demonstrated a notable correlation between the rate of connection of the FPN to the rest of the brain and the availability of depressive symptoms in persons who have not previously been diagnosed with depression. Using BGC, the results estimated that patients with fewer depression symptoms have an FPN hat is more connected to the brain regions.</p>

                    >BGC is a method that evaluates the mean FC between each brain region and the other network brain regions. BGC mitigates the potential bias of other graph centrality metrics, which can be exaggerated in locations with vast networks. A study demonstrated that the BGC in the DMN is relatively low. Another study, using the participation coefficient, showed the same findings as the previous findings. Although the findings of the two studies indicated some similarities, there were some dissimilarities. Some of these disparities might be attributed to BGC and participation
                    coefficient variances. Generally, the participation coefficient is computed by thresholding a graph and then evaluating the distribution of edges between networks. A high value implies that the edges are dispersed evenly to other networks.</span

                  <span
                    >In contrast, a low value shows that the edges preferentially connect nodes in a smaller number of other networks. BGC does not require a graph to be threshold before computation and compares the mean FC weight for each region to all other out-of-network regions. However, previous techniques employing global brain connectivity and degree, which both include within-network connections, result in DMN areas with effective connectivity to the rest of the brain; These findings show that prior studies identifying the DMN as strongly linked to the rest of the brain are mostly
                    driven by high FC within the DMN rather than increased connectivity between the DMN and nodes in other functional networks.</span

                  <span>The brain regions in which the BGC was high are the motor and tactile cortex, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the auditory cortex, and higher order visual regions. BGC was high in the lateral prefrontal regions, and higher order visual areas have more FC and global brain connectivity. The lateral prefrontal cortex, higher-order visual areas, auditory cortex, and somatosensory cortex have all been found to have increased global brain connection.</span>
                  <span>After going through the previous methods and BGC, there were some differences between them. In lower visual areas, BGC was relatively low, in contrast to greater connectivity estimates computed by others. The disparities reported between BGC, and other measures of connectivity strength may be due to BGC failing to account for the relatively strong local connections within the visual network. Indeed, the primary and secondary visual cortex have a higher local connection strength than remote connectivity.</span>

                    >BGC is consistent with the previous attempts at the degree of connectivity classification in brain regions. In fact, BGC’s concentration is quite lower in the lower visual regions. In fact, the primary and the secondary visual cortex show high local connectivity rather than distant ones. The presence of BGC in FPN correlates negatively to depression symptoms, as it was found that individuals who experience greater connectivity of the FPN with the rest parts of the brain experience fewer depression symptoms. This emphasizes that the well-connected FPN can serve as a
                    protective shield against depression and mental health symptoms. In fact, FPN FC decreases were reported in individuals diagnosed with major depression. It helped in dividing depression into subtypes as well. Decreases in FC in the language network have been reported in depression patients and language performance deficits have also been reported in depression patients. The current results might be consistent with these observed deficits in language in depressed individuals. However, future studies should attempt to replicate these results in an independent large
                    sample.</span

                  <p>Severe depression symptoms can cause an obvious reduced FC between dIPFC and the supramarginal gyrus, instead of decreased levels of connectivity between the superior parietal lobule and the dIPFC.

The study was specifically looking for a measure that could quantify the strength of FC for every region compared to every other region in every other network. BGC was determined for each region separately and was established as the mean FC for all connections made outside of the network. All connections from a source region to targets outside the source region's network were referred to as out-of-network connections. Each region of the brain

These findings imply that the global network architecture of the human brain is crucial for preserving mental health, even in those who are undiagnosed, and they lend credence to the idea that the FPN keeps a goal-directed feedback loop in place to control symptoms as they manifest. Future research will be crucial in defining the precise pathways by which
                    FPN affects symptoms and evaluating the feasibility of improving FPN FC with the goal of reducing symptoms and possibly delaying the onset of mental disease.</span

                  <span>Lower limb amputations affect about 28.9 million people worldwide, influencing normal human functions, we are developing a conscious brain mind-controlled Cybonthitic cyborg bionic-leg to provide a professional solution for this problem, which is classified as restricted knee movement, short-term solution, limited pressure bearing, unspecific analog reading of EMG; Because the output voltage measured in nano-volts, resulting in unspecific knee movement. The functionality of these modern gadgets is still limited due to a lack of neuromuscular control (i.e. For movement creation, control relies on human efferent neural signals to peripheral muscles). Electromyographic (EMG) or myoelectric signals are neuromuscular control signals that can be recorded from muscles for our engineering goals. We worked on a sophisticated prosthetic knee design with a 100-degree angle of motion. We also used a specific type of coiled spring to absorb abrupt or unexpected motion force. In addition, we amplified the EMG output from (Nano-Voltage) to (Milli-Voltage) using customized instrumentation amplifiers (operational amplifiers). We used a full-wave rectifier to convert AC to DC, as a consequence of these procedures, sine-wave output voltage measures in millivolts, and the spring constant indicates the most force for every 1cm. Von mises Stress analysis shows bearing as 3000N is the maximum load for the design. Detecting the edge of a stairwell using the first derivative. The benefit of a system that controls the prosthetic limb is activated by the patient’s own EMG impulses, rather than sensors linked to the body.</span>

                  <span>A prosthesis is a term that refers to an artificial device that replaces a physical component or organ. A prosthetic leg replaces a lower limb that has been amputated for many reasons. The National Limb Loss Information Center supplied the amputation data in that there are roughly 1.7 million people living with limb loss in the United States <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="10.5">[5]</tooltip>. A Myoelectric A prosthetic leg, as the name indicates, is a prosthetic leg which employs myoelectric (EMG) impulses for control. This is feasible owing to the fact that the neuro-muscular system of amputees remains intact even after amputation. The remaining signals are made use of, and they are adequate enough to control the movement of the leg after proper processing <tooltip data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-trigger="manual" data-bs-placement="bottom" data-bs-html="true" title="Loading ..." reference-no="10.6">[6]</tooltip>. Actuators such as motors are employed to replace the function that muscles perform by delivering force for movement of the leg. Myoelectric prosthetic legs stand apart from externally powered legs, which rely on external power for controlling the limb from pulses that are sent from your brain.</span>

Two approaches are used to capture these myoelectric signals: inva- sive and noninvasive. Invasive methods use needle electrodes to record the sEMG signal. However, noninvasive is often preferable, since it is positioned right above the skin surface without requiring the electrode to be inserted into the patient’s body. Numerous issues such as motion artefacts, electrode misplacement, and noise interpolation all have an effect on the EMG signal. To extract additional information, signal pro- cessing techniques including as filtering, rectification, baseline drifting, and threshold levelling are used to EMG signals. The block diagram of the EMG signal processing is depicted in (figure 1).</span>

Two electrodes are inserted into the limb’s acromial and clavicular portions of the central deltoid muscle (anterior fibers). For efficient grounding, the other portion is equipped with a ground electrode. Surface electrodes are used to detect EMG signals. However, the selected signal has an amplitude of microvolts. Thus, a preamplifier is required to convert the microvoltage EMG signal (µV) to millivoltage (mV). The EMG signal is delivered into the preamplifier directly from the electrode.

To design an effective filter, comparison is done with various filter topologies. as shown in (fig 3) that HPF and LPF are critical in filtering pulses that have been amplified. The EMG signals that have been saved are processed. To eliminate motion artefacts and external noise from the collected EMG data, a high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz is used. For stop band attenuation, a fourth order Butterworth high pass filter has been used.

                  <span>A corrected signal is required. The goal of rectification is to eliminate the signal’s negative components. By eliminating the negative components, the negative amplitude is converted to a positive value by squaring the total signal. As predicted, this step also squares the amplitude value. Additionally, if the amplitude is less than one, squaring would shift the amplitude away from one toward zero, lowering the value. Amplification is used to increase the signal’s amplitude to a suitable level. The signal is multiplied by a constant value, which increases the amplitude of the whole signal by that amount. The output of this step is a positive signal (devoid of negative components) with an amplitude within the specified range.</span>

                  <span>After the first few processing stages, the signal in hand still resembles an EMG signal in terms of contraction and relaxation phases, with the most noticeable difference being the conversion of negative components to positive ones after rectification. As previously stated, the contraction phase of the signal is the most interesting; thus, it must be separated from the remainder of the signal. This is accomplished by sending the signal through a low-pass filter that detects just the signal’s envelope. Smoothing produces a signal with blunt peaks precisely during contraction stages.</span>

When fabricating a prosthetic limb, it should be lightweight for ease of control and have a good load bearing capability. The prosthetic limb is con- structed from lightweight but robust materials. The limb may or may not have functioning knee and ankle joints, depending on the site of the amputation. The socket is a very accurate cast of your residual limb that fits snugly over it. It assists in the prosthetic leg’s attachment to your body. Suspension systems are used to secure the prosthesis, whether by sleeve suction, vacuum suspension/suction, or distal locking by pin or lanyard. As shown in (fig 4), numbers of models that are created for achieving engineering goals such as high bearing capacity, light, and long-term use.</span>

                  <p>To estimate the intended joint trajectory, myoelectric signals and a pattern recognition algorithm may be used to forecast the user’s locomotor mode. The intended locomotor activity may be anticipated by recog- nising patterns in the EMG data (i.e., since various locomotor activities can be assessed using distinct joint trajectories). Mechanical signals, in addition to EMG signals, may be analysed and utilised for pattern recognition. To discover patterns in myoelectric data, pattern recognition methods such as linear discriminant analysis and dynamic Bayesian networks have been applied. However, these algorithms may introduce significant delays, particularly when switching between loco- motor activities. Successful intent classifiers have been created employing the forces at the human-socket connection, foot- ground contacts, myoelectric signals, and contralateral limb kinematics. It has been shown that including EMG signals and time history data into the control system considerably reduces classification mistakes during human prosthesis locomotion. Researchers have shown that unilateral transtibial amputees can forecast locomotor activity using myoelectric signals from the undamaged biological knee joint. By collecting signals and identifying the greatest and minimum values for data visualisa- tion, we can foresee the appearance and movement of muscles using the candlestick technique for pattern recognition. As the largest value is considered resistance, while the least value is considered support. Max and Min values are gathered and used as reference points for prediction, as they are included into the formula for prediction:</p>

In non- TMR amputees, classification accuracies for these attempted movements were 91.0 ± 4.7% and 86.8 ± 3.0%, Correspond- ingly. This amounts to a 5.0 percent and 5.2 percentage point boost in complete precision, correspondingly. TMR enhances real-time pattern-recognition control by 44 percent and 39 percent, respectively; these data imply that TMR improves real-time pattern-recognition control. Virtual movements were likewise completed more faster by the TMR amputees than by the non-TMR amputees.

                  <span>In this study, EMG signal is successfully extracted from the subject and the acquired EMG signal has two parts: relaxation phase and contraction phase. The contraction phase is what we are interested in for proceeding with the work. In order to control the motor rotation using the EMG signal, the contraction phase is made use of, for which it has to be processed suitably to result in a pulse output whenever the muscle is contracted. The steps involved in processing are those which convert the EMG signal into pulsed output for each contraction. The final output is a pulsed signal where each pulse corresponds to muscle contraction. When considering prosthetics limb, more degree of freedom is required. So our future work extends to signal classification such as K-means algorithm and support vector machine.</span>
